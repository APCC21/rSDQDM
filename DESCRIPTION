Description: This package has been developed for statistical downscaling of CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase five) climate change scenario data at a daily time-scale using empirical quantile mapping method. This package uses the clipped national-level climate change scenario data which is provided through the ADSS (http://adss.apcc21.org/). The original Global Climate Model (GCM) data was collected from the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF, http://pcmdi9.llnl.gov/esgf-web-fe/). Non-parametric (empirical) quantile mapping method was applied monthly for the 6 weather variables provided.
